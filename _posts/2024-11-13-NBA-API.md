In this post I will talk about home court advantage in the NBA. Lots of teams talk about this "Home Court Advantage". Here I will try and explore how much the home court advantage really matters. Looking at not only the difference between home and road wins, but the certain teams. Could certain teams be better at home? Could certain ones be better on the road?


### The NBA API


This NBA API can scrape lots of data from NBA.com. NBA.com keeps track of all the stats. I am only looking at the full court advantage of the 32 NBA teams over the last 7 years. With this you could do all sorts of things. Could look at certain players and their stats. Could compare different teams defensive stats and see if coaches make a difference. There are so many opportunities with web scraping API'S. Some commons scraping that could be used.   

- Collecting players stats
- Looking at player before and after injury stats
- Categorical analysis of strength of schedule and playoff wins
- Numerical analysis of total team points correlated with playoff wins
- Defensive stats compared to playoff wins

### DATA CORRELATION AND DATA CAUSATION

A lot of this data that is collected can be looked at to make assumptions. It is an important tool in Data Science to figure out how to read the Data. If the data is found to be causation it can help you figure out if it is true. If you think wrong and it is only correlated than that can lead you down a rabbit hole of incorrectness in your analysis. Here I will try to do my best to find the causation of the NBA Home court advantage. 




### FINDING THE HOME COURT ADVANTAGE

Ways I will try and find out if the home court advantage is real.

- Home win percentage vs. Road win percentage
- What teams are best at over last 10 years
- What teams had best difference between home and road
- What teams had least amount of difference 
- Points scored at home vs. points scored on road

### LOOKING AT THE DATA

What other observations can you see? What other factors do you believe would make a difference? These and many other questions are what data scientists do all the time to look at the data. There are other things I would like to look at, but I wanted to make those who don't know as much about the NBA still be able to figure out what I was talking about. Web scrapping is a great tool, and a great way to be creative with questions and data as a data scientist!
