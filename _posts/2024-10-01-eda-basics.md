In this post I will talk about the basics of EDA. EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis. EDA is a very essential process in Data Science. EDA is where you really look at the data, and try and figure out what you want to do with it. EDA is a very broad analyzation process where the data scientist can get very creative. This is where I feel is the most fun part of the data science process.

### EDA PROCESS


EDA has its own process that will be good to follow. Some of the things in that you will want to learn are the following. 

- Data Sourcing
- Data Cleaning
- Categorical Analysis
- Numerical Analysis
- Derived Metrics

### DATA CLEANING

Data cleaning is a very important step in EDA. Cleaning is really where you are able to read the correct data that you are trying to work with. If data is all of over the place it can be hard to work with. This helps speed up the whole process, and helps other not just yourself read it better.

-How to handle missing values

	- Delete Rows/Columns
	- Replacing with mean/median/mode
	- Algorithm Imputation
	- Predicting the missing values

These are all different methods you can use and explore with missing values. You can try using all different methods and see which one is best for the data you are working with.

### DATA SOURCING

It is important to know how to get the data that you need. There are two main different types of data.

- Public Data

If you are working with public. data you will probably use skills like web scrapping, and public data files. This is data that is available to everyone on the internet. 

- Private Data

Private Data is when you are working with data in a company that is not to be leaked. This for example could be a bank you are doing work for. If you are a company that gets clients, then you will likely need to get access for data. This is important to know what data you need access to and first get access to all you need so you can properly start the data science process.

### DATA VISUALIZATION

This is the final part where you want to look at the data. Obviously you can make as many as you want and determine what is best to read, and look at the data. Depending on who will be looking at the data, and how it will be presented will be a big factor as well with what you want to do with it.
